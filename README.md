# FAC-Soon_Challenge
This repo is a challenge for SOON_ apprenticeship where we had to replicate a product details page and a simple user flow to add products to a shopping basket. 

## Challenge 1
### Basket App User Flow

- As a user I want to be able to view a product with details: title, description, image, price
- As a user, I want to be able to add a quantity of the product to the basket and see the total item count in the basket from the header

#### Approach 
I tried to use as much CSS from figma as possible but figuring out the structure I found a bit difficult. 
From then, I tried to get the styling of the page settled before I jumped into designing the main flow using javacript. 

My approach to the javascript was to create 3 functions: one to add, one to minus, and one that would add that quantity to the shopping basket. 

#### Challenges
- Adapting to someone else's CSS and 'stacking' flexboxes. 
- lots of trial and error because of the above

#### Wins
- I loved working on the functions. They probably took me the least amount of time to do but still need a bit of testing.
- it was fun sifting through figma and trying to map out how I was going to structure the CSS - thought I think I should have spent more time on making this leaner with stacks and the flexboxes specifically.
