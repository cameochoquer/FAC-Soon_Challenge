## Challenge 1
### Basket App User Flow
I decided to tackle challenge 1: the basket app user flow. 

- As a user I want to be able to view a product with details: title, description, image, price
- As a user, I want to be able to add a quantity of the product to the basket and see the total item count in the basket from the header

#### Approach 
I tried to use as much CSS from figma as possible but figuring out the structure I found a bit difficult. 
From then, I tried to get the styling of the page settled before I jumped into designing the main flow using javacript. 

#### Challenges
- Adapting to someone else's CSS and 'stacking' flexboxes. 
- lots of trial and error because of the above

#### Wins
- I loved working on the functions. They probably took me the least amount of time to do but still need a bit of testing.
